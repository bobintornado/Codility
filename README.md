#Quick Thought

Great tool, I did learn some new tricks (algorithms) along the training, but I still think real-world engineering job duty is significantly different from algorithms test.

The reason being, we don't really judge physicists' achievements by their math ability, even thought that's really important; we don't really judge architects' achievements by their physics reasoning ability, even though that's super critical; and thus we shouldn't judge developers' ability by their familiarity towards algorithms, even though I did think it's very fundamental in our day-to-day job.
